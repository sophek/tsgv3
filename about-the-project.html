<h3 class="post-title">Purpose</h3>
<p>Parents today are faced with a myriad of choices in public education, including traditional public schools, magnet schools and programs, and charter schools. Each option comes with its own system to navigate, and some also involve a complex application process. Building off of our School Rankings, CHILDREN AT RISK has developed Texas School Guide to serve as a one-stop-shop for parents as they navigate these systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Texas School Guide has three main goals. We hope to empower parents to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="text-align: center;">1. Understand How Local Schools are Performing</strong><br />
<strong style="text-align: center;">2. Become Aware of their School Options</strong><br />
<strong style="text-align: center;">3. Become Advocates for High Quality Public Schools</strong></p>
<p>CHILDREN AT RISK piloted this project in the Dallas Independent School District (Dallas ISD) and Fort Worth Independent School District (Fort Worth ISD) areas, and saw such an incredible need that we have expanded our website to include school data for all of the public schools across the state.</p>
