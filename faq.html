    <div id="panel1d" class="content active" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel1d-heading">
      All of the data that appears on the school profiles comes directly from the Texas Education Agency, or was calculated using data from the Texas Education Agency. For example, demographic data and test scores come directly from the Texas Education Agency, but the C@R graduation rate, Rankings, Letter Grades, and Indexes were calculated using specific CHILDREN AT RISK formulas. Information in the Action Guides comes from a variety of sources, including school and district websites, online resources, community partners, and CHILDREN AT RISK research. Visit the various links that are cited under “Resources” to learn more.

    <div id="panel2d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel2d-heading">
      The data used on the school profiles comes from the 2013-2014 school year. The information and resources included in the Action Guides were created and/or updated in 2015, but may reflect general school deadlines from the 2014-2015 school year.

    <a href="#panel3d" role="tab" id="panel3d-heading" aria-controls="panel3d">Why isn’t my school included in this guide?</a>
    <div id="panel3d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel3d-heading">
      <p>Texas School Guide only includes traditional public schools and charter schools that contain grades between Kindergarten and 12th Grade. It does not include private schools or alternative schools. If your school is a public or charter school that is not included, it may be a new school that wasn’t included in 2013-2014 Texas Education Agency reports or it may be an early education campus.</p>

    <a href="#panel4d" role="tab" id="panel4d-heading" aria-controls="panel4d">What is the “PEG” program?</a>
    <div id="panel4d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel4d-heading">
     <p>In 1995, the Texas Legislature created the Public Education Grant (PEG) program [TEC §§29.201 - 29.205]. The PEG program permits parents whose children attend schools on the PEG list to request that their children transfer to schools in other districts or other non-PEG schools within their district. A list of PEG-designated schools is provided to districts annually. By February 1, districts must notify each parent of a student in the district assigned to attend a school on the PEG list. Based on the February list, parents may request a transfer for the following school year. (For example, the list provided to parents by February 1, 2015 allows for transfer requests for the 2015-16 school year).</p>

    <a href="#panel5d" role="tab" id="panel5d-heading" aria-controls="panel5d">What is a “PEG” school?</a>
    <div id="panel5d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel5d-heading">
    <p>A PEG School is one in which:
        <ul>
            <li>50 percent or more of the students did not pass any of the state assessment subjects in any two of the preceding three years (2014, 2013, or 2012),</li>
            <li>Or a school that was rated Improvement Required in 2013 or 2014.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>   

    <p>Through the PEG program, districts receive a slightly higher allocation of funding from the state for each PEG-transferred student. (The additional funding is equal to 10% of the adjusted basic allotment, which varies by school). Visit the Frequently Asked Question page for the PEG Program at http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/peg_faq.html for additional information.</p>
 
    <p>Examples where schools would appear on the current PEG list:
<ol>
    <li type="a">A school that was Improvement Required in 2013,</li>
    <li type="a">A school with fewer than 50% of its students passing reading in 2014 and 2013, and</li>
    <li type="a">A school with fewer than 50% of its students passing science in 2013 and fewer than 50% passing ELA (English, language, Arts) in 2014</li>
</ol>

    <div id="panel6d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel6d-heading">
     <p>The PEG list is released at the beginning of each year and can be found on the Texas Education Agency Website. For the most recent list, visit http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/peg_faq.html.</p>
