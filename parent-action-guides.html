      Early Childhood Education (Ages 0 – 5)

Deciding on a childcare or preschool program for your child can be an overwhelming and
stressful task. There are many things to consider including:

Quality
Location
Cost
Hours of operation
Many of these issues can be easily resolved with a quick phone call or visit to the program’s
website. Judging quality should be a main concern for parents, and may require more effort.

    <div id="panel2d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel2d-heading">
      The first five years of a child’s life are the most important in brain development. During this
time, children learn at a more rapid rate than at any other period in their lives. Children who
attend high quality early education programs are more likely to:

Be ready for kindergarten
Score well on standardized tests
Go to college
Have higher paying jobs as adults
A supportive and engaging early childhood education program is important because it starts
infants and toddlers on the path to lifelong success.

    <div id="panel4d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel4d-heading">
     Early childhood education programs, such as Pre-K and academically focused childcare, set children up to be successful students before they ever step into a kindergarten classroom. These programs should provide children with developmentally appropriate instruction in vocabulary, early literacy, phonemic awareness, math, and other areas that students often struggle with during their elementary years. In addition, these programs also help children become more comfortable with the routines and structures of the school environment.

Licensed childcare facilities are monitored and regulated by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. The state routinely inspects these facilities and enforces basic health and safety standards. You can view records of the state’s inspections at www.dontbeinthedark.org/‎. In addition, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) accredits and certifies centers. The NAEYC standards are much higher than the state’s minimum standards. A list of centers accredited by NAEYC is available at www.naeyc.org/academy/accreditation/search .

In addition to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, there are also several other organizations that provide childcare accreditation, including:

National Association for Family Child Care Accreditation (NAFCC), www.nafcc.org
National Early Childhood Program Accreditation (NECPA), www.necpa.net
National Accreditation Commission (NAC), www.earlylearningleaders.org

    <div id="panel5d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel5d-heading">
     If you need help locating childcare, there are resources available to help! The state of Texas has an official website that can help you find daycare closest to where you live or work. The website can be found here: www.dfps.state.tx.us/Child_Care/Search_Texas_Child_Care/. It also provides other useful information such as a list of involuntarily suspended or revoked child care operations and 24 hour residential operations.

After checking the program’s accreditation status and the state’s records for violations and compliance, you should visit the center to gain a better sense of both the physical and emotional environment.

    <div id="panel6d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel6d-heading">
     <p>During your visit, CHILDREN AT RISK recommends that you should spend 20-30 minutes talking to staff and watching classroom routines (circle time, book reads, and center time are the best times to observe). Try not to visit during meal and nap times, as you will be less likely to see the quality of learning activities between the staff and children.</p>

<p>Things to look for in the classroom’s physical environment:</p>

<p>Classrooms and areas for children should be open and visible from any point within the classroom. This ensures that the teachers can always see your child and make sure that your child is not at risk for injury or participating in unsafe activities.
Age appropriate materials such as alphabet posters, letter walls, calendars, and weather and reading charts should be at your child’s eye level (not near the ceiling or at an adult’s eye level).
For classrooms serving children 3 years and older, look for evidence of writing (both children’s and teacher’s), sorting, and counting, as well as number, letter and word recognition. These are all good signs that the program provides academic enrichment activities.
Things to look for in the classroom’s emotional environment:</p>

<p>Students should feel safe to share their thoughts and feelings in the classroom. The classroom should not be a place for unkind words, bullying, or verbal abuse, as these are detrimental to the child’s well-being and social development.
Ask staff specifically about their discipline policies.
Also watch how staff members interact with one another and to the children both in and out of the classroom.
Teacher Qualifications
Ask teachers and staff about their qualifications. You are trusting your child to their program and have the right to make sure they are qualified! Early childhood teachers should have formal training in the field of early childhood education. The minimum requirements in the state of Texas are</p>

<p>A high school diploma or GED
24 hours of pre-service training, and
24 hours of annual continuing education for early childcare professionals. Suggested teacher trainings include classes on curriculum, safety practices, first aid, and emergency preparedness.
The most common qualifications for early childhood instructors are:</p>

<p>Bachelor’s Degree in Education (or another field) with a teaching certificate from the state specifying an Early Childhood qualification: teachers holding this degree and certification have rigorous training in classroom management, curriculum, and at least one semester of practicum in a classroom under the observation of a mentor teacher.
Early Childhood Associates Degree or Child Development Associates Degree from an accredited program: teachers holding this degree have spent 2 years learning how to provide the appropriate environment and curriculum for children in their classroom.
Other Things to Consider and Ask About:</p>

<p>Waiting lists: Many early childhood programs have waiting lists and a registration process, including a non-refundable deposit.
Food menus: Some programs ask parents to provide the food for their child, while others offer meals and snacks. For those that serve food, menus should be available to give you an example of the types of foods being served. If parents are expected to provide meals and snacks, ask how the food is stored throughout the day (refrigerator or at room temperature) so you know what you should pack.
Time spent on the playground: Children should spend 30-45 minutes on the playground in the morning and afternoon (weather permitting).
Screen time (TV and Computers): It is recommended that screen time be limited to no more than 1 to 2 hours per day for children over 2 years of age, so make sure to ask how the school incorporates TV and computers.
    Childcare financial assistance: Families meeting specific requirements (financial and other factors) are eligible for childcare assistance. Check with your local Workforce solutions office to see if you qualify for childcare assistance. To locate your local Workforce Solutions office, go to: www.twc.state.tx.us/dirs/wdas/directory-offices-services.html</p>

    <p>There are many options for higher education in Texas, including four-year colleges, two-year colleges, and trade schools. An advanced degree or certification can create employment opportunities that may not be available to those with only a high school diploma. It is important to set expectations for post-secondary education, or continued education after high school, early so that children are encouraged to set goals that help them obtain those degrees.

             <p>It is helpful to be knowledgeable about the different opportunities for post-secondary education early in your child’s high school career. This way you can make sure that you do not miss important application deadlines, required high school courses for particular programs, or other steps that must be taken prior to admittance into a higher education program.</p>

<p>If your child intends to pursue higher education, you may want to consider the rigor of the high school they attend. High schools that provide good preparation for college should offer an academically challenging curriculum, a college-bound culture, and a support system for navigating college admissions. Indicators of these characteristics can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wide offering of advanced courses like Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and/or Honors courses</li>
<li>High rate of students taking the SAT or ACT exams</li>
<li>Available and knowledgeable guidance counselors</li>

        <div id="panel9d" class="content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="panel9dd-heading">
               <p>Most post-secondary tracks require some kind of application. Community colleges have an open-door admissions policy, which means that students are admitted regardless of previous academic history. However parents and students should be advised that students in Texas entering a public college institution, including community colleges, must meet the minimum threshold on the Texas Success Initiative (TSI) Assessment unless they are otherwise exempt. If students do not meet this threshold, they may be referred to Adult Basic Education classes, which are non-credit and fee-based, before they are eligible to enroll in college coursework. You can learn more about this requirement at <a href="http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/"><b>http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/</b></a>.</p>
<p>The Common App and Apply Texas are two widely used application processes for four-year colleges and universities. The Common App is used by hundreds of colleges throughout the United States, and Apply Texas allows students to apply for admission to any Texas public university, as well as to participating community and private colleges. To learn more about which schools accept these applications, application deadlines, and additional information visit the individual sites:</p>

                <p>The costs associated with higher education can be daunting for parents, families and students. However, being aware of financial aid opportunities that are at your disposal can help ease your concerns. Each university or college has their own financial aid program, which may include grant and scholarship opportunities, and there are also opportunities to obtain financial aid through the state and federal government, nonprofit and private organizations.</p>
<p>You should submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), as it is will make your student eligible for the largest source of financial aid available. The application becomes available in early January, but deadlines differ by program. You will want to submit the FAFSA as early as possible to make sure that you can take advantage of as many aid opportunities as possible.</p>
<p>There are several ways to file the FAFSA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online at <a href="http://www.fafsa.gov"><b>www.fafsa.gov</b></a>.</li>
<li>You can download or order a paper FAFSA.</li>
<li>Ask the financial aid office at your student’s college or career school if it can be filed there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a brief look at financial aid opportunities and when you should fill out the FASFA from the Federal Student Aid website:</p>

            <p>It is important to plan ahead for higher education while your child is still in high school. In order to apply to a four-year university or college, your child will need to take the SAT and/or ACT exam, typically during their junior year of high school. You also should be aware of the admissions requirements of the program(s) your child may wish to attend, so that they will be sure to fulfill all prerequisites during high school. For example, some universities may require more science or math course credits than your child’s high school requires as the minimum. Your child may also need to take elective courses to be adequately prepared for college.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a timeline that can help students stay on track to obtaining an advanced degree or certification:</p>
<p><b>Freshman and Sophomore Years</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Talk with your assigned guidance counselor about taking college preparatory courses and exploring higher education options.</li>
<li>Start getting involved in extra-curricular activities and keep a record of involvement.</li>
<li>Register and take the Preliminary SAT (PSAT).</li>
<li>Schedule a college tour of an area college to get a feel for what college might be like. These tours are free and you can call the admissions office to schedule a tour at a time that works well for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Junior Year</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Work with your guidance counselor to establish a list of the higher education options that you are interested in. It may be helpful to consider how long it usually takes students to graduate from that school. You can find more information on college completion rates by campus at <b>completecollege.org</b>.</li>
<li>Begin researching scholarship and financial aid opportunities.</li>
<li>Register and take the SAT and/or ACT exams.</li>
<li>If possible, visit the individual campuses that you will be applying to.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Senior Year</b></p>
<ul>
<li>August – September
<ul>
<li>Narrow down school options and create a list of application deadlines and required materials, including scholarship and financial aid deadlines, essays, letters of recommendation and transcripts.</li>
<li>Register or retake SAT and/or ACT exam if necessary.</li>
<li>Begin thinking about who to request your letters of recommendation from.</li>
<li>Request transcripts from your high school</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>October – November
<ul>
<li>Draft any required college admissions or scholarship essays.</li>
<li>Secure letters of recommendation if required. It is best to request letters of recommendation at least one to two months in advance of the application deadline. This allows the recommender time to complete and submit a quality recommendation.</li>
<li>Ensure that your transcripts are accurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>December – January
<ul>
<li>Final application dates for many schools. However, note that early decision applications are typically due in November.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>February – March
<ul>
<li>College acceptance letters begin to arrive.</li>
<li>Parents need to file taxes to prepare for filling out the FAFSA. Remember to complete the FAFSA by the priority deadline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>April – May
<ul>
<li>Review your admissions information and submit any required materials to the college or program of your choice. This may include housing information, final transcripts, a potential deposit, etc.</li>

            <p><strong>What Is School Choice?</strong></p>
<p>School choice is selecting a school for your child based on the qualities of the school and your child’s needs, rather than on your home address. While school choice options vary from district to district, parents do have alternatives to the traditional neighborhood school the district assigns your child to attend. When considering other public school options for children, parents may consider charter schools as well as magnet schools and programs. To figure out which school is best for your child, you should start by researching individual schools.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Neighborhood Schools?</strong><br />
A Neighborhood School is the school that a child is assigned to based on where their family lives. The school district sets boundaries and attendance zones for all schools in the district and these boundaries can change often. You should call your school or the district to confirm your neighborhood school before enrolling.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Charter Schools?</strong><br />
A Charter School is a public school that operates separately from local school districts. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuition-free and publicly funded by local, state, and federal dollars, and can receive private donations</li>
<li>Open to any student within a specified region that wishes to apply</li>
<li>Commonly required to use a lottery system to determine enrollment</li>
<li>Entitled to greater flexibility than neighborhood schools (example: some charters may have a longer school day or year)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Are Magnet Schools?</strong></p>
<p>A Magnet School is a public school that is either run by a school district or a group of school districts. These schools are called magnet schools because they attract students from other areas of the district. These programs and schools offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum that is aligned with a particular focus area (example: Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM), performing arts, leadership, or certain career paths)</li>
<li>A more intensive education in their focus area than traditional public schools</li>
</ul>
<p>Some programs are located within neighborhood schools, while others are “Magnet Schools” that have their own campuses. In some cases, several programs are housed together on one campus.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Private Schools?</strong><br />
A Private School is a school that is not supported by the government. Private schools receive their funding from individuals or a private organization. They usually require students to pay tuition and complete an application process that may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Admission tests</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Financial aid applications</li>
</ul>
<p>Private schools can have a religious affiliation or be independent. Although this guide does not profile private schools, they are one of the available options for parents.</p>

                <p>Parent involvement is a leading factor in student success and outcomes. Students with involved parents are more likely than their peers with uninvolved parents to earn better grades, attend school regularly, have positive attitudes about school, and be better behaved. As a result, parents can help their children succeed by becoming an education advocate. Taking the time to be involved in your child’s education not only allows you to ensure your child is receiving the quality education he or she deserves, but also shows your student how important their academic success is to your family. Advocating for your child’s education means making sure that your child is getting the very best education possible.</p>

<b><a id="relationships"></a>Building Relationships</b>
<p>The first step to becoming an advocate for your child’s education is to form relationships with teachers, counselors, coaches, and administrators at your child’s school. Forming these relationships early in your child’s time at school will make you feel comfortable going to these people when problems or questions come up.</p>
<p>If you have felt frustrated and do not understand the school process, or just have not had the opportunity to form these relationships, here are some great ways to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend school events when you are able, such as open houses, performances or award ceremonies.</li>
<li>Join district groups, such as the School Health Advisory Council that focuses on health and nutrition policies within the district.</li>
<li>Join parent groups or organizations at your child’s school.</li>
<li>Get involved in after school programs that your child is involved in.</li>
<li>Get involved with the Site Based Decision Making Committee at your child’s school.</li>
<li>Volunteer with the school or in your child’s classroom.</li>
<li>Vote in the School Board of Trustees election.</li>
<li>Request a conference with your child’s teacher, counselor, or school administrator. If you work during the school day, you can request a conference at a time that works for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of attending events and direct contact with the school, you can advocate for your child by communicating the importance of education. You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure your child attends school regularly.</li>
<li>Making sure your child does their homework.</li>
<li>Making sure your child gets to school on time.</li>
<li>Regularly checking your child’s progress through Parent Portal to identify any problems early.</li>
<li>Regularly checking your child’s progress through Parent Portal to identify any problems early. On Parent Portal you have access to many school related indicators, including your student’s grades, homework assignments, and teacher contact information. Learn more about Parent Portal at Dallas ISD by visiting <a href="http://www.dallasisd.org/parentportal"><b>http://www.dallasisd.org/parentportal</b></a>.</li>
</ul>
            
<p></p>
<p><a id="ptos"></a>Parent Groups and Organizations</p>
<p>Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs), Parent Teacher Student Associations (PTSAs), and Parent Teacher Organizations (PTOs) engage and empower parents to become advocates for their children. Although these organizations have similar missions, the PTA is connected to a local, state, or national association, while the PTO is specific to an individual school campus.</p>
<p>Many parent organizations keep parents involved and informed about what is going on at school.  This might include organizing a school fundraiser, working with teachers or providing parent trainings on how to get involved at school. If you are interested in getting involved in these organizations, contact your school’s office about how to join. If your school does not currently have a PTA, PTSA or a PTO, you can start one.</p>

<b>Organizing a Parent Teacher Association</b>
<p>Any school official, parent or interested person can organize a PTA. First, gain the support of your school principal or superintendent, and multiple teachers. For more information about organizing a new local PTA, contact the Director of Member Services, Mary Jo Burgess, mjburgess@txpta.org or 1-800-TALK-PTA or visit their website at <a href="http://www.txpta.org/"><b>www.txpta.org</b>.</a></p>

<p></p>            
<b>Organizing a Parent Teacher Organization</b>
<p>To start a PTO, organize a group of interested people, agree on a common goal, and start working together to make it happen. Examples include running an ice cream social for parents, students and teachers to get to know one another, or a school fundraiser to raise money. Because every PTO is an independent organization, bylaws vary by organization. Learn more about organizing a PTO at <a href="http://www.ptotoday.com/"><b>www.ptotoday.com.</b></a><b></b></p>
<p><i>Note that some PTAs and PTOs have small membership fees</i>.</p>

<p></p>
<b><a id="decision"></a>Site Based Decision Making Committee</b>
<p>If you are interested in getting involved in the decision making that goes on at your child’s campus, you might consider joining your school’s Site Based Decision Making (SBDM) Committee. SBDM Committees are school based meetings that include teachers, administrators, community leaders and parents and are open to the public. Even if parents are not part of the committee, attending a SBDM meeting is a good way to meet school officials and learn about the latest updates at your child’s school.<b> </b>Contact your school directly to learn more about SBDM.<b><br />

<p>If you have concerns about your child’s school, first, contact the school’s principal.  If you are unable to resolve your concerns with the principal, you may contact the Board Services Department. Parents can also file a formal appeal against the decision of a principal. If you would like to file a formal appeal, use the following form, located under Policy FNG (Exhibit) <a href="http://pol.tasb.org/Policy/Download/361?filename=FNG(XHIBIT).pdf" target="_blank">on the online Board Policy server</a>.</p>

<b><a id="community"></a>Community Organizations</b>

Some organizations offer parent trainings that can help you learn how to request and have successful conferences with teachers, counselors and school administrators. Here is a brief list of organizations that are working with students and parents in the community:</p>
